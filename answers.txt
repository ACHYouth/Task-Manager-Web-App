The audio aura of a listener can be characterized by calculating the average energy, valence, and danceability of their top 100 songs from 2018. However, this method has limitations, such as not accurately capturing the listener's overall musical preferences, missing out on other songs representing different emotions and moods, and not fully capturing the emotional impact of songs. To improve the audio aura calculation, it is recommended to analyze a longer period, incorporate sentiment analysis of lyrics, and consider the distribution of music genres in the listener's playlist. Additionally, gathering user feedback and contextual data, such as time of day or personal events, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the listener's emotional journey. Such a comprehensive approach considering various factors can offer deeper insights into the listener's musical experience and emotional connections with their favorite music.
