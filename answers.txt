Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With 10 simulations, the results were grossly incorrect, showing that only 4 teams had any chance of winning, and greatly overestimating the chances of these 4 teams. Even with 100 simulations, only 12 out of 14 teams were even given a winning chance, with the order of the teams different from 1000 simulations and above. Thankfully, after 1000 simulations, the predictions seem to stabiltize with very similar results.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: As mentioned eariler, after 1000 simulations, the predictions seem to stabilize, suggesting that conducting 1000 simulations gives the best bang for the buck.
