    <p>Pokémon is a media franchise consisting of video games, television series and films, trading cards, countless pieces of merchandise, and various other products. The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist with creatures called Pokémon, a large variety of species endowed with special powers. The world of Pokémon has three primary goals. The first is to travel and explore new areas. The second is to discover and catch a specimen of each Pokémon species. The third is to train a small team of Pokémon from those caught, and have them battle with Pokémon of others players. The franchise's target audience is boys and girls from 5 to 12, but it is known to attract people of all ages.</p>
