    <h2>How it all began - The History of Competitive Pokemon:</h2>
    <p>Ah, competitive Pokémon, where the excitement and strategy really come to life! It all began back in the late 1990s with the release of the Pokémon video games. As more players delved into the Pokémon world, they started to challenge each other to see who had the best team of Pokémon. This informal competition quickly grew into a full-fledged competitive scene with tournaments and rules, both official and community-based.</p>
