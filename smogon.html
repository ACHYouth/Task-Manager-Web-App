    <h2>Every game must have its rules - Smogon:</h2>
    <p>One of the most prominent communities that emerged was Smogon. They started out as a group of Pokémon fans who wanted to create a competitive environment with clear rules and tiers to balance the vast array of Pokémon available. Smogon developed a tiering system that classifies Pokémon into different levels of usage based on their strength and popularity. This way, you could have battles in various tiers, from OverUsed (OU) to RarelyUsed (RU), ensuring a more diverse and enjoyable competitive experience.</p>
